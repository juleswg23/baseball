# MLB Pitcher Luck Dashboard

This project is a submission for the Posit Table Contest!

## Description:

This dashboard explores the influence of "luck" on MLB pitcher win-loss records, using Great Tables, gt-extras, and py-shiny for Python. Users can interactively sort and filter pitchers by year, team, and key statistics, and visually compare traditional skill metrics (ERA) with "luck" factors (run support and team errors).

## Features:

- Shiny sorting by Wins, Games Started, Run Support, ERA, and Team Errors
- Year and team filtering
- Custom split-bar visualization for "luck" (run support in green, team errors in red)
- MLB team logos and pitcher headshots
- Built with Shiny, Great Tables and gt-extras, and some scraping for images and data (most notably with pybaseball)
